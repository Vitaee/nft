### Environments

#### Development environment
First off all install all dependencies with ```npm i``` command. In this project we have two environments. For development you should create ```.env.development``` file in project directory ( backend folder ).

For now, in ```.env.development```  file we are storing ``` APP_PORT ``` variable. So your .env file will look like this:
```
APP_PORT=3001
```
#### Production environment

In your remote server, you should create ```.env.production``` file. Secondly, put your necessary variables inside to it. Then run this command ```npm run start```. 

### Scripts

Starts the application in development using `nodemon` and `ts-node` to do hot reloading.
